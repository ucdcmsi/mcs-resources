This resource is designed to help you navigate experiences beyond coursework, including research, funding, internships and jobs, as well as learning about the culture of science/academia.

<br>

If you have questions about declaring your emphasis, registering for courses, studying abroad, and joining clubs, you should check out the [MCSci Orientation](https://geology.ucdavis.edu/students/undergrad/mcsci/orientation) page. (You'll also find advice on undergraduate research and scholarship opportunities!)

<br>

This website has been designed with Marine and Coastal Science Majors at UC Davis in mind, but has resources for all marine science undergraduate students.
