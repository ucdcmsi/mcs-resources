## Professional Development Resources

*Accumulated by the Fall 2020 ANS 198: Professional Development Class*
<br />
<br />


### Navigating Lab / Academic Environments
* General Advice: 
  + "The worst thing someone can tell you is no." | "If you don't get rejected with some frequency in life, you are not taking enough risk."
  + The people that you work with in the lab can determine the environment around you. Since lab is usually a competitive setting, it can be hard to work together unless necessary that's why it depends on the people you are working with.     
  + It is never to early to start applying for lab positions even if you think you are underqualified ... Everyone has to start at the bottoms so to speak.
  + Sometimes it's hard to find a job and "stable jobs" aren't always an option in science. The days are always different, and sometimes it can be frustrating, but that it is worth it if it's your calling. 
  + I took a course during Spring Quarter called ESP 198 where graduate students talked about their research!  It was super cool to learn about how the lab can exist outside of the four walls of a building and exploratory environments exist everywhere.
  + Lab culture in academia is different from that of class required labs like in chemistry or biology. It can be very communal and collaborative, where we can ask for help and discuss research.

### Science Writing
* General advice: 
  + Ask experienced people for help, Setting a writing goal for yourself, Remember your audience
  + The scientific writing cycle can take a LONG time because writing a paper is hard, but so is getting it through peer review.

* [Science Buddies](https://www.sciencebuddies.org/)

#### Reading Scientific Papers
* General Advice:
  + Make a note at the beginning of each paper you're reading to let you know how it would be most useful in a paper or in a discussion.

### Jobs / Internships
* General Advice:
  + Identify broad career interests, without worrying about it being too specific. Use the internship opportunity to find what you want to be specific about.

### Grad School
* General Advice:
  + When applying to grad school, applicants need to apply to each program themselves instead of having an app that simplifies the process (like the UC / CSU systems).
  + There are different grad school tracks: professional programs (no thesis/dissertation) & research programs (must write a thesis/dissertation)

### Science Communication
* General Advice:
  + There are two paradigms in which science can be communicated. The dissemination paradigm is a one-way communication system from the experts to the public via media, books, documentaries, websites, etc. The public participation paradigm is one that allows the experts and the public to actively engage with the information through dialogue either through Community Science (collecting data from the public) or Consensus Conference (selectively recruiting a group of public).
* [The Ethogram](https://theethogram.com/)
* [The Science of Science Communication](http://www.nasonline.org/programs/nas-colloquia/completed_colloquia/science-communication.html)
  + Quote: "Communication scientists know something about how messages flow through diverse communications channels, how stakeholders interpret them, and how those processes affect beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors about science and scientists."
